    EarthScope API (Beta) Documentation

    ![EarthScope Facility Logo](https://www.earthscope.org/app/uploads/2024/01/gage_sage_primary_color.svg)  Welcome to the EarthScope Consortium API documentation.   Our API is intended for programmatic access to NSF GAGE and SAGE Facilities' data and metadata. This API can be used with command line tools for automating data access, e.g., **cURL** and **Wget**, and can be directly incorporated into your programs to fetch data.   Our API also powers our online tools for data discovery and access. The dynamic OpenAPI documentation presented here allows you to easily try our API. However, the \"try it out\" forms in these docs are not intended as the primary interface for regular usage.  Authentication is required to use GAGE and SAGE services, please see the [Authentication](#authentication) section below.  ## <a id=\"versions\"></a> Versions The following versions of the EarthScope API have been released: - [beta](/beta/docs)  ##  <a id=\"authentication\"></a> Authentication Our API requires registration and authentication for reporting anonymized usage metrics to our sponsors.  1. [Register and login](https://www.earthscope.org/user/) - [See detailed instructions](https://www.unavco.org/data/gps-gnss/file-server/user-profile.html). 2. Pass your authentication/access token in an Authorization header along with your API request. [See detailed instructions](https://www.unavco.org/data/gps-gnss/file-server/file-server-access-examples.html).  Please see [Authentication](https://www.earthscope.org/data/authentication).  ##  <a id=\"policies\"></a> Policies Access and use of EarthScope's NSF GAGE and NSF SAGE Facility data is governed by the following policies. ### <a id=\"data-policies\"></a> Data Policies - [GAGE Data Policy](https://www.unavco.org/data/policies_forms/data-policy/data-policy.html) - [SAGE Data Policy](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/docs/) - [EarthScope Privacy Policy](https://www.earthscope.org/privacy-policy/) - [EarthScope Terms of Service](https://www.earthscope.org/terms-of-service/)  ### <a id=\"versioning\"></a> Versioning The versioning protocol adopted by the NSF GAGE and SAGE Facilities, operated by EarthScope Consortium, applies to each release of a collection of individual web services, collectively referred to as the EarthScope API. An API version is identified by  the first node of the path following the host name, e.g.,  `api.earthscope.org/beta`, or `api.earthscope.org/v1`, where `beta` indicates a pre-production release and `v1` is the serialized production release version.  The EarthScope API uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to designate specific releases of an API. We increment the API major version whenever we introduce breaking changes. Internally, we use minor and patch versions whenever we add functionality and backward-compatible updates. When we release a new major version of the EarthScope API, clients can choose to either continue using a supported (see our [deprecation policy](#deprecation)) existing major version or migrate to the new one. Here forward, we simply use “version” to refer to our major version releases.  Versions will either be `beta` to indicate pre-production releases or `v1` for specific production version releases, where the number increments, e.g., `v1` to `v2` with each major release. Endpoints identified as `beta` are subject to change \"in place\" without notification and should not be used in critical production systems.  The following points describe what kinds of changes result in an updated version: - A URL path is never really changed; if such a modification is required, the original service path will be [deprecated](#deprecation) and a new one created with a version identifier of `beta` or it's version number incremented. - A change to the internal process of an existing web service will not result in an updated version. - A non-backward compatible change to the output produced by an existing web service will result in an updated version. - The addition of a new, optional, query parameter will not result in a new version and the default value of the query parameter will be set so that the web service will behave as previously if the new parameter is not specified. - The addition of a new, required parameter or a change in formatting of parameter values will result in an updated version.  ### <a id=\"deprecation\"></a> Deprecation   - API version deprecation (end of life) will be announced publicly via our [Data Announcements](https://groups.google.com/a/earthscope.org/g/data-announcements) email list.   - Deprecated services will be labelled “Deprecated” in the respective online API documentation.   - Deprecated services will be retired and removed from our documentation after a period of time to be determined in the deprecation announcement. The deprecation period is intended to allow users time to migrate to newer supported versions of our API.
